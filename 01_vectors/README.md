# Vectors
*Programming Motion.* 

Vectors are the fundamental building blocks we use to programme nature and motion.

A vector has both a **_magnitude_** and a **_direction_** and is typically depicted as an arrow; the direction is indicated by the position at which the arrow is pointing, and the magnitude, by the length of the arrow itself.

Vectors regularly serve as instructions to get from one point to another.

For example: for every frame move by x & y amount of steps ([Motion on a graph, think of Pythagoras.](http://natureofcode.com/book/imgs/chapter01/ch01_02.png))

Therefore, each new [*location*](http://natureofcode.com/book/imgs/chapter01/ch01_03.png) = *velocity* applied to *current location*.

Velocity is obviously a vector as it tells us how to move from one location to another, but is location a vector? In p5.js is it; we describe location as the path taken from the origin to reach that location.
