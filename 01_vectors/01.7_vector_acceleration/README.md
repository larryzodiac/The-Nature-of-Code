# Vector Acceleration
So far we have been able to implement simple motion to our objects.

However, in the real world, objects move in more interesting ways, one being the concept of `Acceleration`

In p5.js the strict definition of acceleration is the `rate of change of velocity`

This isn't that confusing if we think to what we have previously learned about simple motion.

Velocity is defined as the `rate of change of location`

So all we are doing is adding another layer to the process of motion.

To remember this we come up with the acronym `V.A,L.V`

Already we have seen it partially in action:

```
velocity.add(acceleration)
location.add(velocity)
```

## The Code
- [Part_a](Part_a)
- [Part_b](Part_b)
- [Part_c](Part_c)
