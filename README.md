## Using Git
After having set up your account and creating a new repository, on your machine's local drive, create a folder of the same name as your new repository.

Then, open your command prompt.

From here, navigate through the console to your working directory (the new folder).

When in the desired directory, type the following command in your console to initialise an empty Git repository:
```
git init
```

To verify that a new repository has been created, find your working directory in your file explorer and select show hidden files under the view tab. Now a *.git* folder should become visible in the folder, this verifies an initialised Git repository.


## Git Command List
Navigate to your working directory using the command prompt

See the [Git documentation](https://git-scm.com/docs/) for further reference.

git add .
git status
