# Normal Distribution of Random Numbers
When we look at random numbers within a given range, generating them randomly does not accurately depict a distribution of numbers in a real wolrd event. For example, the heights of a population.

We have already looked at probability and how to manually generate non-uniform distribution of numbers.

But how can we simulate this by working around an average?

A distribution of values that cluster around an average is known as a _normal, or, Gaussian distribution._

When we graph this, we get what is known as a bell curve.

> The curve is generated by a mathematical function that defines the probability of any given value occurring as a function of the mean and standard deviation.

The _mean_ is our average.

The _standard deviation_ is simply the range at which the majority of values cluster around our average.

How close or far they spread.

A low standard deviation would mean that the majority of values cluster closely around the mean.

A higher standard deviation would produce these values more evenly spread out.
