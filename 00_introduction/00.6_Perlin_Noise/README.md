# Perlin Noise
Randomness can be a good thing when programming lifelike events. 

However, randomness as the single guiding principle is not necessarily natural.

But these random numbers hold no relationship and show no discernible patterns.

This may be a detrement to our efforts to emulate the real world.

An algorithm named `Perlin Noise` takes this concept into account.

Perlin Noise is used to generate various effects with natural qualities, such as clouds, landscapes, and patterned textures.

> Perlin noise has a more organic appearance because it produces a naturally ordered, smoother sequence of pseudo-random numbers.

p5.js has a built in function `noise()` we will use to implement this concept.

See [reference](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/noise).
