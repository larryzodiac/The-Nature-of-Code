# Probability & Non-Uniform Distribution of Numbers
The problem we face in The Nature of Code is how we may most accurately distribute nature.

In the previous exercise, we observed that in the _random()_ function, each number has an equal chance of being selected.

Over time the outcomes will level out, we observe _uniform number distribution._

But this is not the case for real life events.

Daniel Shiffman uses the example of Darwinian evolution in monkeys.

Not all monkeys are equal, fitter ones will have a more likely chance to succeed etc.


We use the example of a deck of cards to look at _single event probability._

The probability of drawing an ace:

```
number of aces / deck = 4 / 52 ≈ 8%
```

or, say a diamond:

```
number of diamonds / deck = 13 / 52 ≈ 25%
```

This is where we need to leanr to manipulate the chance of outcome

We'll use a few tricks with _random()._

## The Code
- [Part_a](Part_a)
- [Part_b](Part_b)
